# Computer_Vision

This repository is a collection of practical computer vision projects designed to explore, implement, and benchmark modern techniques used in real-world applications.

The goal of this repository is twofold:

    1) Deepen my expertise as a Computer Vision Engineer

    2) Build end-to-end, production-oriented projects that demonstrate strong fundamentals, modern tooling, and clean engineering practices

Most projects are inspired by sports analytics and visual understanding, but the techniques are transferable to many domains such as healthcare, retail, robotics, and autonomous systems.
